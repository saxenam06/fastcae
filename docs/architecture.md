# Architecture

## The claim the architecture has to support

fastcae is a **general platform**. The gearbox housing in `assets/` is one study. Tomorrow it is a
bracket, then a shaft. Every layer has to survive that without an edit.

The arc, in the order it runs:

> **Extract → Model → Generate → Simulate → Learn → Optimize**

Generate leads because it is the thing a solver cannot do: the campaign, the training set and the
search all exist to serve designs that had to be generated first.

Extract and Model are built. The other four are shown in the interface and not yet implemented — a
shell that hides its unbuilt stages describes a tool; one that shows them describes a product.

## The rule that keeps it general

**Geometry gives you the *kind*. Documents give you the *role*.**

A concave cylinder is a **bore** — true of a housing, a bracket and a shaft alike. Whether it is
*controlled*, and what it is called, is something a document has to say.

Kinds are universal, so they live in code. Roles are per-part, so they arrive from artifacts.

A module that detects "the dowels that locate a ring gear" has to be edited before a bracket can
load. One that detects "equal holes repeated on a circle" does not.

### Nothing absolute that governs geometry

An absolute millimetre threshold is a hidden assumption about part size. Half a millimetre of chord
tolerance is reasonable on a two-metre casting, is a percent of a forty-millimetre bracket, and is
larger than a five-millimetre one.

So every tolerance that governs geometry is derived from the model's own bounding diagonal:

| quantity | derivation |
|---|---|
| tessellation chord tolerance | `diagonal × 2.5e-4`, clamped to 0.01–1.0 mm |
| small-hole threshold | `diagonal × 0.03` |
| axis coincidence | `diagonal × 1e-3` |
| concentricity of a pattern to an axis | `diagonal × 1e-3` |
| ray offset for visibility testing | `max(diagonal × 5e-6, 10 × weld tolerance)` |
| similarity of two faces by radius | `diagonal × 5e-5` |
| drawing-to-model size match | `diagonal × 2.5e-4`, capped at 0.5 mm |

What stays absolute is what genuinely does not scale: the 1 µm vertex weld tolerance, which sits
between the sub-micron mismatches real CAD carries and the smallest geometry anyone deliberately
models. Angles, counts and fractions are dimensionless and need no derivation.

### Units are declared, not inherited

OCC rescales a STEP into whatever `xstep.cascade.unit` names, and that setting reads as **empty**
by default — so the system was relying on an unstated default being millimetres. It is now set
explicitly, and the unit the file declares is read from its own records and reported. A file
drawn in inches would otherwise have been silently 25× wrong with nothing to notice it.

## Layers

```
project.py     a folder of artifacts. The only unit of configuration.
geometry/      B-rep in, tagged surface out. Knows shapes, never purposes.
features.py    generic feature detection. No domain vocabulary anywhere.
drawing.py     PDF text to callouts. Every one cites its page and literal text.
extract.py     the deterministic pipeline, and the drawing-to-CAD association.
provenance.py  Evidence, Fact, Conflict. How anything is known.
api/app.py     HTTP surface. Routes contain no logic.
```

## Provenance

Every fact carries `Evidence`: a source kind, a locator specific enough to return to, the method,
and a confidence. A `Fact` resolves to one of four states — `measured`, `derived`, `assumed`,
`conflicted` — computed, never set by hand.

Two things the model deliberately does not do:

**It does not rank sources into one authority order.** A drawing is authoritative for what is
*controlled*; the CAD for what was *modelled*. Which wins depends on the question.

**It does not resolve conflicts.** A disagreement is information, and collapsing it into a single
number destroys the only signal that something needs a person.

Conflicts are recorded and **not shown**. A conflict is what two confirmed facts do when they
disagree, and nothing in the system is confirmed yet, so a disagreement between two things nobody
has agreed are the same feature is an open question rather than a conflict. It surfaces one link
earlier, as a task - see [tasks.md](tasks.md).

## The command layer

`api/app.py` is the single seam between the engine and anything driving it. The browser calls it
over HTTP; an agent will call the same routes with no privileged path.

**Routes contain no logic.** A route unpacks a request, calls one engine function, and packs the
result. Anything a route can do that the engine cannot is something an agent will not be able to do.

## The interface

Six stages, always shown. `available` gates interaction, never display.

The card vocabulary is the test of whether the model is general — each card renders one *kind of
thing the platform knows about*, never one kind of part:

| card | shows |
|---|---|
| **Artifact** | an extracted input, what was read from it, how far it can be trusted |
| **Step** | one pipeline stage: what it did, or precisely why it did not run |
| **Feature** | a detected geometric feature |
| **Callout** | one claim read off a drawing, beside the literal text it came from |
| **Fact** | a value with every source behind it |
| **Metric** | a measured quantity with its unit |

If a card would be meaningless for a bracket, it belongs somewhere else.

Nothing tints the default 3D view. An always-on colour reads as a selection the viewer did not
make and competes with the one they did; controlled faces have their own mode, entered
deliberately.
